# Experimenting

```
git add -v .
git commit -a -m "I made a small change"
git push
```

<aside class="notes">
Reveal is very powerful, so try exploring some of its features, but be careful not to make any changes that you can't roll back. In other words, make a change, use git to add, commit, and push. Then test. If you don't like the change, you can always roll it back. If you do this, then you will be able to fix things easily if you break something by reverting your last commit. If you are testing locally, you don't have to push your changes. Just commit them. You will still be able to roll them back using the git revert command.

# Enjoy

<aside class="notes">
Once you get used to using reveal, you might actually enjoy the fact that all you have to do is write. No more messy GUI hiding your text from you. No more buttons and drop-downs and the temptation to use too many effects. You now have a very powerful tool in your hands for creating presentations that can be shown in any web browser, anywhere. If you keep your work in GitHub or somewhere similar, you can also easily share your finished presentations.
